Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin and Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology, Germany
- Established a Snakemake pipeline for statistical analysis and downstream visualisation of allele-specific gene expression (ASE)
- Investigated ASE as smoking injury proxy in CRUK lung cancer cohort ([paper](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.24.21266740v1))
- Analysed allele-specific copy number in colorectal cancers in collaborations ([paper](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/emmm.202114123))
- Applied regression methods to predict the functionality of somatic mutations in pan-cancer using WGS, RNA-seq, and epigenetic predictions from a deep leanring model in ICGC PCAWG working group
- Using single cell RNAseq data and somatic variants to uncover phenotypes of tumour-adjacent cells
- Developing an ML framework to identify informative somatic variants from WGS, WES, and single-cell RNAseq data from CRC patients

#### Master of Science, Translational Medical Research _(09.2016-03.2018)_
Major in Molecular Oncology, Heidelberg University, Germany
